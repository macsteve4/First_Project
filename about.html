            <h3>Currently</h3>
            
          <p>I am interested in honing my creative and artistic skill with a blend of my love of technology. I want to create pieces that viewers can engage with and enjoy daily. I think that it is incredibly necessary to utilize creative expression in our digital lives, especially as designers. I recently have found myself to be drawn in the direction of marketing communications.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>I have been making art since I could pick up a pencil. I would always be doodling in class or sketching funny scenes in my mind. As I grew, I took a four year arts and media program at my high school. I wanted to create this site to serve as a gallery for my creative pieces that I have created in the last two years or so.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am studying at Drexel University, where I am pursuing a major in Interactive Digital Media. While my studies have taken me closer towards the field of UI/UX design, I have still had the opportunity to grow this gallery. As my endeavors expand, so will this site.
