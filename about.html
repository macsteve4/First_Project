            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            
          <p>My name is Steven McInerney. I am a digital designer currently based in Philadelphia, studying Interactive Digital Media at Drexel University.</p>

            <h3>Some Background</h3>
            <p>I am interested in honing my creative and artistic skill with a blend of my love of technology. I believe that it is incredibly necessary to utilize creative expression in our digital lives, especially as designers.
            <br>
            <br>
            While my studies have taken me closer towards the field of UI/UX design, I have had the opportunity to grow my creative gallery. My skills and interests follow; <b> design for media production, html & css, adobe creative cloud software, user-demographic research, photography, & interface/interaction design</b>.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have been making art since I could pick up a pencil. I would always be doodling in class or sketching funny scenes in my mind. As I grew, I took a four year arts and media program at my high school.
            <br>
            <br>
            As my creative endeavors expand, so will this site. I have been pursuing interests in music production and focusing in on marketing communications in addition to my digital art.
